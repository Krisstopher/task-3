              When artificial intel&shy;ligence soft&shy;ware like ChatGPT writes,
              it con&shy;siders many options for each word, tak&shy;ing into ac&shy;count
              the response it has writ&shy;ten so far and the question be&shy;ing asked.
              It as&shy;signs a score to each option on the list,
              which quan&shy;ti&shy;fies how likely the word is to come next,
              based on the vast amount of hu&shy;man-writ&shy;ten text it&nbsp;has&nbsp;analyzed.
              <br/>
              &emsp;ChatGPT, which is built on what is known as a large lan&shy;guage model,
              then choo&shy;ses a word with a high score, and moves on to the next one.
              The model’s out&shy;put is of&shy;ten so so&shy;phi&shy;sticated that it can seem like
              the chat&shy;bot un&shy;der&shy;stands what it is saying — but it&nbsp;does&nbsp;not.
              <br/>
              &emsp;Every choice it makes is de&shy;ter&shy;mined by com&shy;plex math and huge
              amounts of data. So much so that it often pro&shy;duces text that is both
              cohe&shy;rent and ac&shy;curate. But when ChatGPT says some&shy;th&shy;ing that
              is un&shy;true, it inherently does not&nbsp;realize&nbsp;it.
              <br/>
              &emsp;It may soon become com&shy;mon to en&shy;counter a tweet, es&shy;say or
              news article and wonder if it was writ&shy;ten by artificial
              intel&shy;ligence soft&shy;ware. There could be quest&shy;ions over the
              author&shy;ship of a given piece of writ&shy;ing, like in academic set&shy;t&shy;ings,
              or the vera&shy;city of its con&shy;tent, in the case of an article. There could also
              be quest&shy;ions about auth&shy;enti&shy;city: If a mis&shy;lead&shy;ing idea
              sud&shy;denly ap&shy;pears in posts ac&shy;ross the inter&shy;net, is it
              spread&shy;ing organic&shy;al&shy;ly, or have the posts been ge&shy;nerated by A.I.
              to cre&shy;ate the ap&shy;pearance of real&nbsp;traction?
              <br/>
              &emsp;Tools to iden&shy;tify whet&shy;her a piece of text was writ&shy;ten by A.I.
              have star&shy;ted to emerge in recent months, in&shy;clud&shy;ing one created by
              OpenAI, the com&shy;pany be&shy;hind ChatGPT. That tool uses an A.I. model trained to
              spot dif&shy;feren&shy;ces bet&shy;ween gen&shy;erated and hu&shy;man-writ&shy;ten
              text. When OpenAI tes&shy;ted the tool, it cor&shy;rec&shy;tly iden&shy;tified A.I.
              text in only about half of the gen&shy;erated writ&shy;ing sam&shy;ples it analyzed.
              The com&shy;pany said at the time that it had
              rele&shy;ased the experimen&shy;tal de&shy;tec&shy;tor
              <i>“to get feed&shy;back on whether im&shy;perfect
                tools like this one&nbsp;are&nbsp;useful.”</i>
              <br/>
              &emsp;Iden&shy;tify&shy;ing gen&shy;erated text, ex&shy;perts say, is
              be&shy;com&shy;ing increas&shy;ingly dif&shy;ficult as soft&shy;ware like ChatGPT
              continues to ad&shy;vance and turns out text that is more con&shy;vinc&shy;ingly
              hu&shy;man. OpenAI is now ex&shy;periment&shy;ing with a tech&shy;nology that would
              in&shy;sert special words into the text that ChatGPT gen&shy;erates, mak&shy;ing it
              easi&shy;er to de&shy;tect later.
              The tech&shy;nique is known as&nbsp;watermarking.
              <br/>
              &emsp;The water&shy;mark&shy;ing met&shy;hod that OpenAI is exp&shy;lor&shy;ing is
              si&shy;milar to one des&shy;cribed in a recent paper by re&shy;searchers at the
              Univer&shy;sity of Maryland, said Jan Leike,
              the head of align&shy;ment at OpenAI. Here is how&nbsp;it&nbsp;works.

              When Microsoft intro&shy;duced a new version of its Bing search engine that includes
              the artificial intel&shy;ligence of a chatbot last week, company execu&shy;tives
              knew they were climbing out&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;limb.
              <br/>
              &emsp;They expected that some res&shy;ponses from the new chatbot might not be
              entirely accurate, and had built in measures to protect against users who tried to
              push it to do strange things or unleash racist or harm&shy;ful&nbsp;screeds.
              <br/>
              &emsp;But Microsoft was not quite ready for the sur&shy;prising creep&shy;iness
              exp&shy;erienced by users who tried to engage the chatbot in open-ended and probing
              personal conver&shy;sations — even though that issue is well known in the small world
              of re&shy;searchers who specialize in artificial intel&shy;ligence.
              <br/>
              &emsp;Now the company is con&shy;sidering tweaks and guardrails for the new Bing in
              an attempt to reel in some of its more alarming and stran&shy;gely human&shy;like
              responses. Microsoft is looking at adding tools for users to restart
              conver&shy;sations, or give them more control over&nbsp;tone.
              <br/>
              &emsp;Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s chief tech&shy;nology officer, told The New York Times
              that it was also con&shy;sidering limiting conver&shy;sation lengths before they
              veered into strange ter&shy;ritory. Microsoft said that long chats could confuse the
              chatbot, and that it picked up on its users’ tone, some&shy;times turning&nbsp;testy.

            Ivy Berubes, 22, orders a Shirley Temple at the Sarapes Mexican Restaurant bar.
            They make it for her even though it’s not on the menu.
            The menu also doesn’t list “The Tommy Bowl” — a deconstructed burrito
            — but Tommy Agramonte, 20, gets to order it; after all, it is named after him.
            Sade Guess, 21, swears by the birria tacos, another off-menu&nbsp;item.
            <br/>
            &emsp;Located in Enfield, a quiet Connecticut suburb near the border of Massachusetts,
            Sarapes is owned and operated by the Chavez Mellado family,
            who immigrated from Mexico in&nbsp;the&nbsp;1980s.

          <p class="text without-first-letter-style">
            said Adrian Martinez Chavez, the photo&shy;grapher for this story, whose grandparents
            Eduardo Chavez Solano and Cutberta Mellado de Chavez started the restaurant.
            His grand&shy;father passed away a few years ago; Adrian’s
            grandmother and his aunt María Del Carmen Chavez run the place now,
            and his cousins Xochitl and Zuyuani Llanas, 22 and 20, are both&nbsp;managers.
            <br/>
            &emsp;What keeps these 20-somethings coming back to Sarapes is not just the secret(ish)
            menu items or the occasional impromptu conga line that snakes around the booths.
            The space is a physical reminder of their kinship. When they come home to Sarapes,
            they can return to where they&nbsp;started.
            <br/>
            &emsp;Over the years, Sarapes has become a staple

              The mosquitoes that transmit the disease dramatically increased their range
              over the last century as temperatures warmed, scientists&nbsp;reported.
              <br/>
              &emsp;Warming temperatures are chasing animals and plants to new habitats, sometimes
              with devastating consequences to ecosystems. But there is little evidence
              regarding how far and how fast the invaders might&nbsp;be&nbsp;moving.
              <br/>
              &emsp;A new study offers a glimpse of the future by looking to the past. Mosquitoes
              that transmit malaria in sub-Saharan Africa have moved to higher elevations by
              about 6.5 meters (roughly 21 feet) per year and away from the Equator by 4.7
              kilometers (about three miles) per year over the past
              century, according to&nbsp;the&nbsp;study.
              <br/>
              &emsp;That pace is consistent with climate change and may explain why malaria’s
              range has expanded over the past few decades, the authors said. The results
              have serious implications for countries that are unprepared
              to cope with&nbsp;the&nbsp;disease.
              <br/>
              &emsp;Most studies on the impact of climate change on health tend to
              focus on the spread of disease — which can be tricky to trace to any single
              cause — and to be predictive. The new study is instead a retrospective
              look at how mosquitoes have&nbsp;moved.

              An experiment with bone-conduc&shy;tion head&shy;phones suggests a way for
              neuroscien&shy;tists to better under&shy;stand some&nbsp;hallucinations.
              <br/>
              &emsp;It is the rare person who likes hearing their own voice on a recor&shy;ding.
              It sounds fake, somehow — like it belongs to someone&nbsp;else.
              <br/>
              &emsp;For neuro&shy;scien&shy;tists, that quality of other&shy;ness is more than a
              curiosity. Many mys&shy;teries remain about the origins of hal&shy;lucina&shy;tions,
              but one hypo&shy;thesis sug&shy;gests that when people hear voices, they are hearing
              their own thoughts dis&shy;guised as another
              person’s by a quirk of&nbsp;the&nbsp;brain.
              <br/>
              &emsp;Scien&shy;tists would like to under&shy;stand what parts of the brain allow us
              to re&shy;cognize our&shy;selves speaking, but studying this using recor&shy;dings of
              people’s own voices has proved tricky. When we talk, we not only hear our voice
              with our ears, but on some level we feel it as the sound
              vib&shy;rations travel through the bones of&nbsp;the&nbsp;skull.
              <br/>
              &emsp;A study published Wednesday in the journal
              Royal Society Open Science attem&shy;pted a&nbsp;workaround.

              have to pay for had we met under dif&shy;ferent cir&shy;cums&shy;tances.

              &emsp;When clients pried, I liked turning the ques&shy;tion back&nbsp;on&nbsp;them.

              &emsp;“John is my real name!” he might say, laug&shy;hing at the idea that he,
              unlike me, would have any&shy;thing to hide. “John is my real name too,”
              I might say with&nbsp;a&nbsp;wink.

              A single mother, alone with a toddler in a foreign country,
              finds com&shy;munity during Covid — and then creates one&nbsp;for&nbsp;others.

              &emsp;My ex was a bad hus&shy;band but a good horse trainer. When we met, he had just
              bought a pony for 50 euros that the seller swore was un&shy;break&shy;able.
              Three months later, he sold it for 10 times that
              price as a child’s Christ&shy;mas&nbsp;present.
              <br/>
              &emsp;He was kinder to horses than he was to me. He had bet&shy;ter luck
              train&shy;ing them, too. His attempts to break me were easy to brush off at
              first, but they grew more force&shy;ful after our son was born. On our baby’s
              first birth&shy;day, he told me that if I didn’t obey him, he would have
              me depor&shy;ted back to America and keep our son&nbsp;in&nbsp;Ireland.
              <br/>
              &emsp;I reacted the way any threat&shy;ened animal mother would:
              I took my baby&nbsp;and&nbsp;ran.
              <br/>
              &emsp;After a brief brush with home&shy;les&shy;sness,
              we moved to a rural cot&shy;tage I could barely afford even with multiple jobs.
